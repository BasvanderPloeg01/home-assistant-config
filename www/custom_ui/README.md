# Custom UI state cards

These third-party state cards are used to adapt the looks of Home Assistant sensors for easier information consumption.

- **[Custom UI elements](https://github.com/andrey-git/home-assistant-custom-ui)** to improve the display of sensors and jazz up the interface a bit.
- **[Horizontal line state card](https://github.com/covrig/homeassistant-hline)** to visually separate long lists of sensors.
- **[Text-only state card](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/display-only-text-in-card/20536/26)** for wordy sensor states.
