# AppDaemon _Modern_ custom theme

This theme is based very closely on the [default](https://github.com/home-assistant/appdaemon/tree/master/appdaemon/assets/css/default) one, except with some minor tweaks to the CSS and extra classes and variables to support [`/appdaemon/custom_widgets/`](../../custom_widgets).
