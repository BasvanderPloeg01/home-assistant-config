[AppDaemon](https://home-assistant.io/docs/ecosystem/appdaemon/) offers [many default widgets](https://github.com/home-assistant/appdaemon/tree/master/appdaemon/widgets/), but can also support third-party and custom ones.

- Added support for entities used as **title** and **title2**.


### [`ðŸ”˜ input_select.yaml`](input_select.yaml) and [`baseselect`](baseselect)

Selector widget also from [ReneTode's repo](https://github.com/ReneTode/My-AppDaemon/tree/master/custom_widgets/baseselect), modified with:

## Custom widgets

### [`ðŸ‘½ entitysensor.yaml`](entitysensor.yaml) and [`baseentitydisplay`](baseentitydisplay)

Multipurpose widget based on the default [basedisplay](https://github.com/home-assistant/appdaemon/tree/master/appdaemon/widgets/basedisplay) but with the following modifications:

### [`ðŸ“¸ entitycamera.yaml`](entitycamera.yaml) and [`baseentityiframe`](baseentityiframe)

IFrame widget to showcase images and slideshows, based on the default [baseiframe](https://github.com/home-assistant/appdaemon/tree/master/appdaemon/widgets/baseiframe) but includes:
- Cache-buster added to already parameterized URLs.
- Optional **cache** integer parameter to add longevity to the cache-buster JS parameter.


###  [`ðŸ“¶ multisensor.yaml`](multisensor.yaml) and [`basemultisensor`](basemultisensor)
Multi-sensors widget, like the **entitysensor** above, but adds:
- List two sensors size by side (useful to showcase both _temperature_ and _humidity_ together). 


## Customization

The extra styling of these widgets is done in the theme [`/appdaemon/custom_css/modern/`](../custom_css/modern) as well as directly in [`/appdaemon/dashboards/`](../dashboards).
