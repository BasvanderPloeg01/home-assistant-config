# Cameras

I use camera sensors to fetch and display web images in [`/appdeamon/dashboards`](../appdeamon/dashboards).


## Environment Canada radar maps

Rain and snow radar maps for the last 30 minutes or so, gathered to create simple animations in [`/appdeamon/dashboards/Weather.dash`](../appdeamon/dashboards/Weather.dash).


## NOAA (U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) satellite imaging

Colourized and water vapour satellite images for the current air masses. Unlike the radar maps above these are not animated because precision is less relevant at those scales.


## Wallpapers

Pretty daily pictures from Bing and NASA, showcased in [`/appdeamon/dashboards/Main.dash`](../appdeamon/dashboards/Main.dash)
